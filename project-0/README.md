# Project 0 - Google Search Front End

#### Description:

Hi there! This is project 0 for CS50w called 'Search', where I had to build the front-end
for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. In doing so, I tried
to accurately replicate Google's current front end to improve my navigation around inspector
tools, analysing the HTML and CSS of Google's search pages.
